# Online-Resume

This is the first Capstone Project for the online course 'The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp' from App Brewery.<br>
We are supposed to make an online resume using only HTML and this is what I'll do first.<br>
As I progress through the course I'll update it using CSS, Javascript and so on. I plan to have an HTML version then HTML+CSS and so on.<br>
Let's see what happens.<br>
Please, feel free to browse the code and to suggest any changes on it. I'm just starting to code in HTML, so I guess I won't do things the best way posible.
