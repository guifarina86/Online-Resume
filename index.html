    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>After years managing my family-owned micro digital printing business, I am looking to change careers and develop myself in the area of fullstack web development.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>Info Digitus Ltda (2004 - Present)</h3>
      <p><a href="https://infodigitus.com.br">Web Page</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/info-digitus/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/knUoHgA9p83rewnKA">Google My Business</a></p>
      <h4>Partner</h4>
      <p>As one of the owners of the firm I have no unique role. Since it is a very small company with less than 10 employees within a very competitive sector, though the balance sheet is positive it is always tight, not allowing the firm to hire experts for some specific job. For the last 20 years I have done it all, from feeding the printers with papers to the indispensable Google SEO.</p>
      <p>When the firm had to change its printer supplier around 2010, I developed the application (made with Visual Basic 6) we use (until today) to transform digital files into printed paper. Always making sure the firm's clients get whatever their demand is.</p>
      <p>I am also responsible for the firm's web page and LinkedIn and GMB profiles. Up to the moment the firm's online presence is weak and I am currently working on it to generate new sales through the web. Currently our salesman relies in door-to-door and lists of emails sales.</p>
      <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed the firm's current application to transform digital files (.csv, .txt, .pdf) into printed paper</li>
        <li>Developed a data input via barcode which saved hundreds of hours of work per year. Until 2010 all the data input was done manually, with the operator going through each field to input the information; now it is done with one click</li>
        <li>Responsible for drawing (using CorelDRAW) all the necessary forms for all the projects to work</li>
        <li>Assembled and managed the team responsible for the firm's 2024 rebranding and new website</li>
        <li>Responsible for the firm's Google and LinkedIn profiles</li>
        <li>The firm's "psychologist", repairing social bridges destroyed with ongoing day-to-day life stress between employees</li>
        <li>The "go to guy" whenever any problem of any nature seemed to big to handle</li>
        <li>Peacemaker and problem solver since 2004</li>
      </ul>
