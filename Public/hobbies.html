    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I feel very blessed for having had the opportunity to try all the things I tried during my whole life since I was a little kid. I had the opportunity to try myself in many sports, instruments and other cool things. I will make a brief list of some of the hobbies I have/had in my life.</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <h3><em>Hooked since forever</em></h3>
    <p>I will not lie: playing video-games (in general) has been one of the few things that I have done for all my life. I never gave up on it. Obviously, as I got older and older I overgrew some games and that "gaming lifestyle" and finally became what they call a "grown up" (a person who works to pay his bills).</p>
    <p>I still play some games, but I am currently without a gaming PC and have only this decent Dell notebook in which I am typing these words. This brave notebook can only handle 90's games, which is great because <b>I love the 90's games</b>. There was a time, believe me, that you paid for a full game without having to make any micro transaction to move forward. It was brilliant! Yes, you had the bug problem which would never receive a patch. I prefer the bug.</p>
    <p>Because of this gaming PC void, I am only playing games on GOG Galaxy. As many other gamers, I have a Steam account also, but for the modern games.</p>
    <p>
      My gaming profiles:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/guilhermefarina/">Steam</a> - <em>Guilherme Farina</em> (no creativity for nicknames)</li>
        <li>GOG Galaxy - look for <em><b>GFARINA86</b></em></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><em>My favorite games from the 90's</em></h3>
    <p>Below, a list with my top 3 games from the 90's with their respective release date.</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>
        <b>Diablo (December 30, 1996)</b><br>
        <img src="../Assets/Images/diablo-1996-cover.png" widht="260" alt="cover art of the game diablo from 1996">
        <p>I played this game when I was only 10. I had a blast! At that time I thought gaming could not be better than that.</p>
        <p>It had only three classes to play: warrior, rogue and sorcerer. After the Hellfire expansion release (expansion means today's DLC) the class monk was included.</p>
        <p>It is funny because I was a little affraid to play this game and mess with the forces of the evil xD</p>
        <p>Classic RPG game with hack and slash action, a must play game.</p>
        <p>Good times...</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Close Combat 2 (December 31, 1996)</b><br>
        <img src="../Assets/Images/close-combat-2-1996-cover.png" width="260" alt="cover art of the game close combat 2 from 1996">
        <p>Amazing RTS game inspired by WW2 events.</p>
        <p>You can command either the allies or the germans on their way to victory</p>
        <p>Of course, the graphics compared with what we got today is very poor. But the mechanics of the game is amazing.</p>
        <p>You setup the distribution of your units (soldiers, tanks and so on) at the beggining of the battle and then start moving them around.</p>
        <p>Strategy is really necessary: deploying smokes, surpressing fires and other combat skills are needed to achieve the victory in every map.</p>
        <p>What I like about this game is that you need to have some solid strategy and above all patience to execute it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Age of Empires I (October 13, 1997)</b><br>
        <img src="../Assets/Images/Age_of_Empires_Coverart.jpg" width="260" alt="cover art of the game age of empires 1 from 1997">
        <p>This game is pretty popular in the gaming community.</p>
        <p>Another RTS where you have to advance through the ages managing the economy of your empire.</p>
        <p>There are several civilizations to choose from and each has its own ups and downs.</p>
        <p>People still play this game, but gamers prefer Age of Empires 2. I do not know why and never did any research on the topic.</p>
        <p>I lost count of how many hours I spent playing this game and improving my economics skill. I have never beaten the PC in the hardest difficulty. But this is because they manage their economy perfectly and take the best decisions in the blink of an eye. Not fair xD</p>

        <h2>Surfing</h2>
        <h3><em>Best vibe ever</em></h3>
        <p>Being from a big city like São Paulo the best entertainment you get is the shopping malls. Personally speaking, it is not enough for me.</p>
        <p>Luckly we have a beach only 80 km away from the city, making sand, sun and sea a real breeze.</p>
        <p>The best time I had in my small surfing "carrer" was from 2008 to 2013. I used to go to the beach every single weekend.</p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>May 19, 2012. This photo was taken using GoPro 2. I love this photo because it takes me to that day, I can almost feel it all over again by just looking at it. It was a cloudy cold autumn day and the sun was battling to show up (but never did, not that day). The waves were not that big, but they were good to surf. It was a happy day!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In April 2009 I met my wife. We had very good years there in the beach. Oh boy, how I enjoyed those waves! I felt like life could not be any better than having my girlfriend with me and my surfboard.</p>
        <p>I even tried to teach her how to surf but I was not a good teacher and she never stood up. But who cares? We had lots of fun anyway!</p>

        <h3>Jiu-Jitsu</h3>
        <h3><em>O S S</em></h3>
        <p>In 2021 right after the pandemic me and my wife moved to the beach. I thought it would be like surfing everyday!</p>
        <p>But what really happened was that in the course of one year I only went in the sea two times (as in 1+1). Why? Because of sanitary issues. Beaches in Brazil receive all the contents of your toilet <b>without</b> any kind of treatment. Yes, the way you make it while seated is what the beach gets. Literaly: <em>what you see is what you get.</em></p>
        <p>So I decided to sell my surfboards and buy a gi (or kimono) and decided to learn jiu-jitsu.</p>

        <p>The first school I went to was not very good, but I was lucky enough to find a black-belt to teach me the basics.</p>
        <p>I'm still practicing it and evolving very fast!</p>
