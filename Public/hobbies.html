    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I feel very blessed for having had the opportunity to try all the things I tried during my whole life since I was a little kid. I had the opportunity to try myself in many sports, instruments and other cool things. I will make a brief list of some of the hobbies I have in my life.</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <h3><em>Hooked since forever</em></h3>
    <p>I will not lie: playing video-games (in general) has been one of the few things that I have done for all my life. I never gave up on it. Obviously, as I got older and older I overgrew some games and that "gaming lifestyle" and finally became what they call a "grown up" (a person who works to pay his bills).</p>
    <p>I still play some games, but I am currently without a gaming PC and have only this decent Dell notebook in which I am typing these words. This brave notebook can only handle 90's games, which is great because <b>I love the 90's games</b>. There was a time, believe me, that you paid for a full game without having to make any micro transaction to move forward. It was brilliant! Yes, you had the bug problem which would never receive a patch. I prefer the bug.</p>
    <p>Because of this gaming PC void, I am only playing games on GOG Galaxy. As many other gamers, I have a Steam account also, but for the modern games.</p>
    <p>
      My gaming profiles:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/guilhermefarina/">Steam</a> - <em>Guilherme Farina</em> (no creativity for nicknames)</li>
        <li>GOG Galaxy - look for <em><b>GFARINA86</b></em></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><em>My favorite games from the 90's</em></h3>
    <p>Below, a list with my top 3 games from the 90's. In parenthesis I will leave the game's date of release.</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>
        Diablo (December 1996)<br>
        <img src="../Assets/Images/diablo-1996-cover.png" alt="cover art of the game diablo from 1996">
        <p>I played this game when I was only 10. I had a blast! At that time I thought gaming could not be better than that.</p>
        <p>It had only three classes to play: warrior, rogue and sorcerer. After the Hellfire expansion release (expansion means today's DLC) the class monk was included.</p>
        <p>It is funny because I was a little affraid to play this game and mess with the forces of the evil xD</p>
        <p>Classic RPG game with hack and slash action, a must play game.</p>
        <p>Good times...</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Close Combat 2 (December 1996)<br>

        <p>Amazing RTS game inspired by WW2 events.</p>
        <p>You can command either the allies or the germans on their way to victory</p>
        <p>Of course, the graphics compared with what we got today is very poor. But the mechanics of the game is amazing.</p>
        <p>You setup the distribution of your units (soldiers, tanks and so on) at the beggining of the battle and then start moving them around.</p>
        <p>Strategy is really necessary: deploying smokes, surpressing fires and other combat skills are needed to achieve the victory in every map.</p>
        <p>What I like about this game is that you need to have some solid strategy and above all patience to execute it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        People's General (December 1997)<br>
      </li>
